# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Junjie Yang

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)
I started working on this project on June 7, 2023 and continued until the due date. Each time I worked on this project I focused on the project. Each time I worked on this project, according to WakaTime, it took me about 8 hours a day to complete the work for that day.
## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
...
I am most satisfied with my GUI program because it results in the same output items as the examples. After testing the project, I get a full sense of achievement when the output results are correct.
## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
...
I'm not too happy with the aspect of the project where I'm looking for mistakes and improving. I spend most of my time looking for conflicts in different coding and improving them, and worry about not being able to finish the project before the deadline because of the amount of time spent. One of the things I am not yet proficient in is the usage of some of the classes, which I have done by looking up information.
## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...
I experimented with writing code using SRP, trying exception handling, list comprehension and working with all the new concepts my lecturer taught me, as well as meeting requirements.
## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...
I felt that although the results of my project were consistent with the sample output, I wasted too much time and spent hours trying to figure out a mistake that could have actually been solved through my tutor's lectures and querying the internet.
## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
...
I used the lecture slides uploaded at learnJCU and to further my understanding I also used chatgpt to check the usage of part of the code.
## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
... 
The main challenge I faced was the constant disparate code errors in main.py, I used exception handling to resolve these errors.
## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...
Using classes has been very helpful in improving my code. Not only did it improve the reuse of the program, it also provided a structure that made the coding look organised and broke them into logical chunks, which made it easier for me to manage.
